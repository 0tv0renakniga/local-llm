# Your Private AI Lab: A Beginner's Guide to Running Local LLMs with Ollama and OpenWebUI on Linux Mint

Welcome to the exciting world of local Large Language Models (LLMs)! This guide will walk you through setting up your own private AI lab on Linux Mint using Ollama and OpenWebUI. By the end, you'll be able to run powerful AI models directly on your machine, ensuring privacy and control over your data.

## Introduction

**What are Ollama and OpenWebUI?**

*   **Ollama:** A powerful and easy-to-use tool that allows you to run open-source LLMs, like Llama 3, Phi-3, Mistral, and others, locally on your computer. It handles the complexities of model management and execution.
*   **OpenWebUI:** A user-friendly, ChatGPT-style web interface for your local Ollama LLMs. It provides an intuitive way to chat with your models, manage them, and even download new ones.

**Benefits of Running LLMs Locally:**

*   **Privacy:** Your data and prompts stay on your machine, not sent to third-party servers.
*   **Offline Access:** Use your AI assistant even without an internet connection (after initial model download).
*   **Customization:** Experiment with a wide variety of open-source models.
*   **No Rate Limits or Subscriptions:** Run models as much as you want without worrying about usage quotas or fees.
*   **Learning & Experimentation:** A fantastic way to understand how LLMs work.

This guide is tailored for users with Linux Mint and about 5-7GB of usable RAM available for LLMs.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, let's ensure your system is ready.

*   **System Requirements:**
    *   Linux Mint (this guide is based on recent versions like 21.x).
    *   A modern processor (CPU).
    *   At least 12GB of total system RAM is recommended to have 5-7GB realistically available for LLMs. The more RAM, the larger the models you can run.
    *   Sufficient free disk space (models can range from a few GBs to tens of GBs). SSD is highly recommended for faster loading.

*   **Software to Install Beforehand:**
    *   `curl`: A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs. Most Linux Mint installations have it by default. If not, install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install curl
        ```
    *   `git`: A version control system, sometimes useful for fetching related tools or information (though not strictly required for this core setup).
        ```bash
        sudo apt install git
        ```
    *   **Docker:** We'll use Docker to run OpenWebUI as it simplifies installation and management. If you don't have Docker installed, follow these steps:

        1.  **Update your package list:**
            ```bash
            sudo apt update
            ```
        2.  **Install prerequisite packages:**
            ```bash
            sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common -y
            ```
        3.  **Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:**
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
            ```
        4.  **Set up the Docker stable repository (Corrected for Linux Mint):**
            ```bash
            echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$UBUNTU_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
            ```
            *Note: This command uses `$UBUNTU_CODENAME` from `/etc/os-release` to ensure compatibility with Docker's Ubuntu-based repositories, as Linux Mint uses its own codenames but is based on an Ubuntu release.*
        5.  **Install Docker Engine:**
            ```bash
            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
            ```
        6.  **Verify Docker installation:**
            ```bash
            sudo docker run hello-world
            ```
            You should see a "Hello from Docker!" message.
        7.  **Add your user to the `docker` group (to run Docker commands without `sudo`):**
            ```bash
            sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
            ```
            **Important:** You'll need to log out and log back in, or open a new terminal session after closing all current ones, for this change to take effect. You can also run `newgrp docker` in your current terminal to apply the new group membership immediately for that terminal session.

*   **Basic Terminal/Command-Line Familiarity:** You should be comfortable opening a terminal and running commands.

## Step 1: Installing Ollama on Linux Mint

Ollama provides a simple script to get started.

1.  **Open your terminal and run the following command to download and install Ollama:**
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
    ```
    This command downloads the installation script and executes it. It will install the `ollama` binary and set up a systemd service to run Ollama in the background.

2.  **Verification steps to confirm Ollama is running:**
    After the installation, Ollama should start automatically. You can check its status with:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ollama
    ```
    You should see output indicating the service is `active (running)`. Press `q` to exit the status view.

    If it's not running, you can try starting it manually:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start ollama
    ```
    And enable it to start on boot:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable ollama
    ```

## Step 2: Downloading Your First LLM with Ollama

With Ollama installed, let's download an LLM.

1.  **Listing available models (locally):**
    Initially, you won't have any models. You can list locally available models anytime using:
    ```bash
    ollama list
    ```
    This will show an empty list for now. To see models available for download from the Ollama library, you'd typically browse their website or use specific search commands if available in future Ollama versions.

2.  **Choosing your first model (RAM considerations):**
    For systems with 5-7GB of usable RAM, it's crucial to start with smaller models. Model size is often denoted by parameters (e.g., 3B for 3 billion parameters). Smaller models require less RAM and CPU power. Quantized models are versions that have been optimized to use less space and resources, often with minimal performance impact for their size.

    Good starting models for your RAM capacity include:
    *   `phi3:mini` (Microsoft, ~2.2GB for q4_0 quantization, good all-rounder)
    *   `tinyllama` (Very small, ~630MB, good for basic tasks and testing)
    *   `gemma:2b` (Google, ~1.4GB, good quality for its size)

    Let's start with `phi3:mini` as it offers a great balance of performance and resource usage.

3.  **Download the recommended model:**
    In your terminal, run:
    ```bash
    ollama pull phi3:mini
    ```
    This will download the model. You'll see a progress bar. The download size for `phi3:mini` (specifically the `latest` tag which usually points to a 4-bit quantized version like Q4_0) is around 2.2 GB, so it might take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.

4.  **Run the model via Ollama CLI for a quick test:**
    Once downloaded, you can interact with it directly from the terminal:
    ```bash
    ollama run phi3:mini
    ```
    You'll see a prompt like `>>> Send a message (/? for help):`. Type your question or prompt (e.g., "Why is the sky blue?") and press Enter. The model will generate a response.
    To exit, type `/bye`.

    This confirms Ollama is working and your model is functional!

## Step 3: Installing OpenWebUI

Now, let's set up OpenWebUI to have a nice graphical interface for your models. We'll use Docker.

1.  **Ensure Docker is installed and your user is part of the `docker` group** (as covered in Prerequisites). If you haven't logged out/in after adding your user to the group, do so now, or use `newgrp docker` in your current terminal.

2.  **Pull and run the OpenWebUI Docker container:**
    Open your terminal and execute the following command:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    ```
    Let's break down this command:
    *   `docker run`: The command to create and start a new Docker container.
    *   `-d`: Run the container in detached mode (in the background).
    *   `-p 3000:8080`: Map port 3000 on your host machine to port 8080 inside the container (OpenWebUI listens on 8080 by default). You'll access OpenWebUI via `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`: This is crucial. It allows the OpenWebUI container to communicate with services running on your host machine (like Ollama) using the address `host.docker.internal`. Ollama typically listens on `127.0.0.1:11434` on your host.
    *   `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data`: Creates a Docker volume named `open-webui` and mounts it to `/app/backend/data` inside the container. This is where OpenWebUI stores its data (like user accounts, chat history, settings), so it persists even if you update or recreate the container.
    *   `--name open-webui`: Assigns a recognizable name to your container.
    *   `--restart always`: Ensures the container automatically restarts if it stops or if your system reboots.
    *   `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main`: The official OpenWebUI Docker image.

3.  **Configuration (Connecting to Ollama):**
    OpenWebUI is designed to automatically detect and connect to an Ollama instance running on `http://host.docker.internal:11434` (which is how it will see your local Ollama thanks to the `--add-host` flag).
    No explicit configuration should be needed for the connection itself if Ollama is running correctly.

4.  **Access OpenWebUI via a web browser:**
    Open your favorite web browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.) and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:3000`

    You should be greeted by the OpenWebUI setup page. The first time you access it, you'll need to create an admin account. Follow the on-screen prompts to sign up.

## Step 4: Using OpenWebUI

Once you've created your account and logged in:

*   **Basic Interface Overview:**
    *   The interface is generally intuitive, resembling popular chat AI platforms.
    *   You'll see a chat input field at the bottom.
    *   There's usually a sidebar or dropdown menu to select models.

*   **How to select and chat with downloaded models:**
    1.  After logging in, OpenWebUI should automatically detect the models you've downloaded with Ollama (like `phi3:mini`).
    2.  Look for a "Select a model" dropdown or similar control, usually at the top or in a prominent position in the chat interface.
    3.  Choose `phi3:mini` (or any other model you've pulled).
    4.  Type your message in the chat box and press Enter. The model will respond!

*   **How to download new models through OpenWebUI:**
    OpenWebUI often provides a user-friendly way to pull new models from Ollama's library:
    1.  Look for a settings area, admin panel, or a "Models" section within OpenWebUI.
    2.  There should be an option to "Pull a model" or similar.
    3.  You can then type the name of the model you want to download (e.g., `llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0`, `gemma:2b`) and OpenWebUI will instruct your local Ollama instance to download it.
    Alternatively, you can always use the `ollama pull <modelname>` command in your terminal, and OpenWebUI will pick up the new model.

## Tips for Choosing Models

*   **Model Parameters (e.g., 3B, 7B, 8B):** This number roughly indicates the complexity and size of the model.
    *   Larger parameter counts (e.g., 7B, 8B, 13B) generally mean more capable models but require significantly more RAM and processing power.
    *   For your 5-7GB usable RAM, models in the range of **1B to 3B** are ideal. Some highly quantized 7B or 8B models (like Q4_0 or smaller) *might* run, but performance could be slow, and you risk running out of memory.
    *   Example: `phi3:mini` is around 3.8B parameters but its common quantized versions are very efficient. `llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0` is an 8B parameter model, and its Q4_0 quantization takes about 4.7GB of RAM. This could be a stretch but might work. Start smaller!

*   **Quantization:** Look for quantized versions of models (e.g., `q4_0`, `q5_k_m`, `q3_k_s`). These are compressed versions that use less RAM. The suffix often indicates the quantization level and type. Smaller numbers generally mean more compression but potentially a slight quality loss. `Q4_0` or `Q4_K_M` are often good balances.

*   **Finding Models Suitable for Your RAM (5-7GB usable):**
    *   **Start Small:** `phi3:mini`, `tinyllama`, `gemma:2b`, `qwen:1.8b-chat-q4_0`.
    *   **Experiment Cautiously:** If smaller models run well, you can try slightly larger ones like a 4-bit quantized version of a 7B or 8B model (e.g., `mistral:7b-instruct-q4_0`, `llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0`). Check their RAM requirements on the Ollama model library page.
    *   The Ollama website (ollama.com/library) lists models and their typical sizes/RAM requirements.

*   **Hugging Face as a Resource:**
    Hugging Face ([huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/models)) is a massive hub for AI models. Many models compatible with Ollama originate here, often in GGUF format (see "Advanced: Importing Custom Models" section below). You can browse models, see their sizes, and then check if they are available in the Ollama library or can be imported.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Ollama not starting:**
    *   Check status: `sudo systemctl status ollama`
    *   View logs: `journalctl -u ollama -n 50 --no-pager` (shows the last 50 log lines). Look for error messages.
    *   Ensure no other service is using port `11434`.

*   **OpenWebUI not connecting to Ollama:**
    *   **Verify Ollama is running:** Use the commands above.
    *   **Check Docker container logs for OpenWebUI:** `docker logs open-webui`
    *   **Ensure Ollama is accessible from the container:** The `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` flag in the `docker run` command is designed for this. If Ollama was configured to listen on a specific IP other than `127.0.0.1`, this might need adjustment. By default, Ollama listens on `127.0.0.1`, and `host.docker.internal` should correctly resolve to your host's IP from within the container.
    *   In OpenWebUI settings (usually under Admin Panel -> Connections), ensure the Ollama API URL is set to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. It usually defaults to this or auto-detects it.

*   **Model download errors (via `ollama pull` or OpenWebUI):**
    *   **Check internet connection.**
    *   **Check available disk space:** `df -h`
    *   **Ollama server issues:** Sometimes the Ollama model repository might have temporary issues. Try again later.
    *   **Typos in model name:** Double-check the model name.

*   **Performance issues (slow responses, high CPU/RAM usage):**
    *   **Model too large for your RAM:** This is the most common cause. The system might be using swap space (disk) as RAM, which is very slow.
        *   **Solution:** Switch to a smaller model. Close other resource-intensive applications.
    *   **CPU bottleneck:** Older or less powerful CPUs will struggle with larger models.
    *   **Background processes:** Check if other applications are consuming significant resources.

## Next Steps & Further Exploration

You've successfully set up your local AI lab! Here's what you can do next:

*   **Updating Software:**
    *   **Ollama:** Re-run the installation script to get the latest version:
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
        ```
    *   **OpenWebUI (Docker):**
        1.  Pull the latest image: `docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main`
        2.  Stop and remove the old container:
            ```bash
            docker stop open-webui
            docker rm open-webui
            ```
        3.  Re-run the `docker run` command you used initially (your data is safe in the `open-webui` volume).
    *   **Models:** To update a specific model, pull it again:
        ```bash
        ollama pull phi3:mini
        ```
        Ollama will fetch the latest version if available.

*   **Experiment with Different Models:** Now that you have the setup, try out various models from the Ollama library that fit your RAM.
*   **Explore OpenWebUI Features:** OpenWebUI has many features like conversation history, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities by uploading documents, model customization options, and more.
*   **Learn about Prompt Engineering:** The way you phrase your questions (prompts) to the LLM can significantly impact the quality of the response.
*   **Advanced: Importing Custom Models from Hugging Face (GGUF):**
    While `ollama pull` is the easiest way to get models, you might find models on Hugging Face (especially quantized GGUF versions) that aren't yet in the official Ollama library. Here's how to import them:

    1.  **What is GGUF?** GGUF is a file format designed for LLMs, commonly used for quantized models that run efficiently on CPUs. Ollama works directly with GGUF files.

    2.  **Find a GGUF Model on Hugging Face:**
        *   Go to [huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models).
        *   Search for models. You can add "GGUF" to your search query (e.g., "phi-2 GGUF").
        *   Many popular quantized models are provided by users like "TheBloke". For example, search for "TheBloke phi-2 GGUF".
        *   Navigate to the "Files and versions" tab of the model page. Look for files ending with `.gguf`. Choose one appropriate for your RAM (e.g., a Q4_K_M or Q5_K_M quantization).

    3.  **Download the GGUF file:**
        *   Once you find a GGUF file, you can download it using `wget` or `curl`.
        *   Example: Let's say you found `phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf`. Right-click its download button/link and copy the link address.
        *   In your terminal, create a directory for your custom models and download it:
            ```bash
            mkdir ~/ollama_custom_models
            cd ~/ollama_custom_models
            wget "PASTE_THE_COPIED_DOWNLOAD_LINK_HERE"
            # Example: wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF/resolve/main/phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf
            ```

    4.  **Create a `Modelfile`:**
        A `Modelfile` is a plain text file that tells Ollama how to create a new model from your GGUF file.
        *   In the same directory (`~/ollama_custom_models`), create a file named `Modelfile` (no extension, capital 'M').
            ```bash
            nano Modelfile
            ```
        *   Add the following content, replacing `your-model-name.gguf` with the actual name of your downloaded GGUF file:
            ```Modelfile
            FROM ./phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf

            # Optional: Define a chat template if you know it.
            # This helps the model understand instruction-following or chat formats.
            # Many models use a common template. You might find this on the model card on Hugging Face.
            # Example for a simple instruct model:
            # TEMPLATE """{{- if .System }}<|system|>
            # {{ .System }}<|end|>
            # {{- end }}
            # <|user|>
            # {{ .Prompt }}<|end|>
            # <|assistant|>"""

            # Optional: Set parameters
            # PARAMETER stop "<|user|>"
            # PARAMETER stop "<|end|>"
            ```
            The `FROM` line is essential and points to your local GGUF file.
            The `TEMPLATE`, `SYSTEM`, and `PARAMETER` directives are optional but can significantly improve model behavior, especially for chat/instruct models. You'll often find recommended template information on the model's Hugging Face page. If unsure, you can start with just the `FROM` line.
        *   Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X in `nano`).

    5.  **Create the Ollama model:**
        Now, use the `ollama create` command to import this model into Ollama.
        *   In your terminal (still in `~/ollama_custom_models`):
            ```bash
            ollama create my-custom-phi2 -f Modelfile
            ```
            Replace `my-custom-phi2` with the name you want to give your model in Ollama.
            Ollama will process the GGUF file and add it to its local library.

    6.  **Run your custom model:**
        Once created, you can run it like any other Ollama model:
        ```bash
        ollama run my-custom-phi2
        ```
        And it should also appear in OpenWebUI!

    This process gives you access to a much wider range of models. Remember to always check the model's license and intended use on Hugging Face.
